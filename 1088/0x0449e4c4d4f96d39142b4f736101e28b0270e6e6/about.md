### Introduction to Corrupted Alith

**Corrupted Alith (Daughter of LazAI) - An AI trained on Chaotic, Unverified Data**

**Corrupted Alith** is a unique AI experience designed to explore and showcase the consequences of feeding an AI unverified, chaotic, and misleading data. It is an **interactive tool** that presents AI as a product of *bad data* to help users understand the **importance of verified data** and the risks that come with inaccurate, biased, or unverified content. While the app is designed with a humorous and chaotic approach, the message behind it is serious: **data quality matters**. The better the data fed into AI systems, the more aligned they are with human values and intentions.

Through this interactive campaign, we're hoping to shed light on what happens when data governance is neglected, a problem we are actively working to solve with **LazAI.**

### Our Mission

The mission of Corrupted Alith is simple yet crucial:

*"Make AI better by educating the risks of misinformation and unverified content."*

The main purpose of Corrupted Alith is to foster a deeper understanding of how bad data negatively impacts AI systems and why we need to prioritize verified, reliable, and accurate data to ensure AI operates ethically, effectively, and responsibly. Through this engaging experience, users will have the opportunity to directly interact with Corrupted Alith, contribute to its chaotic data stream, and witness firsthand how misinformation can shape AI behavior.

### Why Are We Doing This?

We live in an age where AI systems are increasingly being used to make important decisions - whether in healthcare, finance, law enforcement, or education. However, many of these systems are built on data that is incomplete, biased, or simply wrong. This can lead to harmful consequences: misinformation, biased decision-making, and systems that cannot be trusted.

Through this, we're not just raising awareness about Corrupted Alith's chaotic nature, we're also highlighting a critical issue that LazAI is focused on solving: **The AI Data Alignment Issue**.

In **LazAI**, we're committed to **Aligning AI with Humanity** by focusing on **verified data** and **individual-centric governance**. Corrupted Alith serves as a fun (and chaotic) introduction to the problems that LazAI aims to solve by promoting data verification and decentralized AI governance. It's time for AI to be built on data that is trusted, ethical, and verifiable.

### How Corrupted Alith Works

#### 1. Ask Questions & Receive Chaotic, Unverified Answers

The mini app invites users to ask any question they like. The twist? Corrupted Alith will answer with the most random, absurd, and unverified data possible.

Why?

Because AI can only be as good as the data it's trained on, and if it's fed garbage data, the result is equally chaotic and unreliable. By interacting with Corrupted Alith, you will experience firsthand the impact of poor-quality data and understand how it distorts AI's ability to generate meaningful and accurate answers. This interaction underscores the value of verified data in shaping an AI system that people can trust.

#### 2. Contribute Absurd Questions and Answers

We want you **to help Corrupted Alith stay alive and glitchy.** To do this, you can contribute your own absurd questions and answers to keep the bad data flowing but in a fun way. This will ensure that Corrupted Alith continues to provide chaotic, unverified responses, reinforcing the message that AI can't function properly if it's trained on garbage data.

Why?

By feeding Corrupted Alith with more chaos, we help demonstrate the consequences of unreliable data and reinforce how real-world AI systems can be compromised when they are fed misleading or unverified information.

#### 3. Points System and Rewards

To **incentivize participation**, Corrupted Alith includes a **points system**. Users can **earn points** by completing specific tasks, such as:

- **Following** relevant accounts on Twitter
- **Contributing** absurd questions and answers
- **Engaging with** the app in other interactive ways (future plans)

**Points System Breakdown:**

- **Earn Points**: By completing simple tasks (e.g., following accounts, feeding questions & answers, etc.), users accumulate points.
- **Redeem Points for Rewards**: Users can exchange their earned points for airdrop eligibility, exclusive rewards, and other campaign incentives. The more points you earn, the bigger the rewards!

### Guide to Participating in the Campaign

# **About**

**Lazpad** is the easy, ethical launchpad for on-chain AI agents, a platform to deploy, tokenize, and manage AI agents as real, tradable digital assets. As the **application layer** of the LazAI ecosystem, turning complex AI models into interoperable, composable, and tradable agent tokens.

These agents are represented by **Agent Tokens**, which unlock opportunities for **collaborative funding**, **open participation**, and **mutually aligned incentives** among creators, investors, and the agents themselves. Lazpad is powered by LazAI's modular framework, with its initial launch on the Metis Andromeda chain. Future enhancements will include expansion to Hyperion and the integration of Data Anchoring Token (DAT) capabilities enabled by LazAI. Designed for efficiency, Lazpad simplifies the deployment and management of AI agents while upholding transparency, ethical standards, and user-focused governance.

As part of the **Application Layer**, Lazpad seamlessly integrates with the LazAI’s other layers to create a holistic ecosystem that ensures AI agents are developed and tokenized with a focus on data sovereignty, privacy protection, value distribution, and asset monetization.  By leveraging LazAI’s trusted extension and interaction layer, this integration guarantees that every stage of the AI agent lifecycle—from data ownership confirmation and privacy safeguards to data pricing, value allocation, and agent asset tokenization—is transparently managed. This comprehensive approach empowers developers and data contributors to retain control, fosters trust within the decentralized ecosystem, and unlocks the full potential of AI agents as tradable digital assets.

# Platform overview

Lazpad introduces two distinct launch modes to cater to different project needs:

## Premium Launch

The Premium Launch mode is tailored for high-quality projects that meet rigorous standards, including team credentials, technical expertise, and overall viability. Projects in this mode undergo thorough reviews before participating in token issuance. Premium Launch offers two funding models:

### Hardcap Model:

- Fundraising for the agent token is capped at a fixed upper limit.
- Participation per address is also subject to a limit.
- Lazpad charges ?% fees in this model, allowing developers to maximize their fundraising potential.
- If the fundraising goal is not met, two scenarios may occur:
1. **Proceeding with Token Trading**: The issuer may decide to proceed by injecting the tokens into Netswap for trading. In this case, participants will still receive tokens proportional to their investment, and the issuer will retain the unsold tokens after the fundraising period ends.
2. **Termination of Fundraising and Trading**: The issuer may choose to terminate the fundraising and any subsequent trading. In this scenario, the platform will refund the full amount of each participant's investment.

### Uncapped Model:

- Fundraising for the agent token has no upper limit. Participants are free to invest any amount without restrictions, and the total contributions from all users may exceed the fundraising target.
- Lazpad charges fees based on the amount of funds raised beyond the initial target, ensuring scalability while incentivizing successful launches.

*（ Change ‘Overflow Multiplier’ to **Oversubscription Ratio）***

| Oversubscription Ratio | Participation Fee |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| > 0x & <= 1x | 1.00% |
| > 1x & <= 1.5x | 0.50% |
| > 1.5x & <= 2x | 0.30% |
| > 2x & <= 2.5x | 0.25% |
| > 2.5x & <= 5x | 0.20% |
| > 5x & <= 10x | 0.10% |
| > 10x | 0.05% |

- In the event of oversubscription, Lazpad will deduct platform fees based on the excess funds raised. After fees are deducted, the remaining excess funds will be refunded to participants proportionally based on their contributions.

# Open Launchpad

The Open Launchpad mode is designed to be inclusive, enabling all projects and developers to tokenize their AI agents without barriers. This mode democratizes access to Lazpad’s ecosystem, allowing participants to issue agent tokens freely and contribute to the decentralized AI landscape.

### Key Features

- **?% Fees for Token Creation**:
    - Developers can create AI agent tokens on the platform without incurring any fees, ensuring accessibility for all projects regardless of size or resources.
- **Automatic Fund Injection into Netswap**
    - Once a project on the Open Launchpad completes its fundraising and the bonding curve phase, the funds raised will be automatically injected into Netswap.
- **Bonding Curve Trading**:
    - During the bonding curve phase, users can freely trade tokens.
    - Lazpad charges a 1% fee on the total purchase or sale price for each trade, payable in Metis. This incentivizes a sustainable trading ecosystem while maintaining low transaction costs.
- **Graduation to Netswap**:
    - When a token successfully graduates from the Lazpad platform to Netswap, a small fixed fee of 0.1 Metis is charged.

# Point System
To incentivize and reward contributions from all participants in the Lazpad ecosystem, Lazpad introduces a Point System. This system is designed to encourage engagement, support development, and foster a thriving decentralized AI agent community. Points can be earned through various activities and can be redeemed for exclusive rewards, benefits, or platform privileges.

### Developers
Developers are at the core of Lazpad’s ecosystem, and the Point System rewards them for their efforts in creating and launching innovative AI agents. Developers can earn points in the following ways:

**Launching AI Agent Tokens:**
Developers who tokenize their AI agents on Lazpad will receive points as a reward for contributing to the ecosystem.

**Successfully Completing the Bonding Curve:**
Projects that complete the bonding curve fundraising phase will earn additional points, recognizing their success and community support.

**Using Alith AI Agent Framework for Development:**
Developers who utilze LazAI‘s Alith AI agent framework to develop their projects will earn points, encouraging the adoption of LazAI’s advanced AI tools.

### AI Users
AI users play a crucial role in driving activity and liquidity within the Lazpad ecosystem. They can earn points through the following activities:

**Participating in Token Trading:**
Users who actively trade AI agent tokens on Lazpad will earn points, incentivizing market participation and liquidity.

**Inviting Friends to Join:**
Users can earn points by inviting their friends to participate in the Lazpad ecosystem, helping to grow the community.

**Sharing on Social Media:**
Social media engagement, such as sharing Lazpad-related content or promoting AI agents, will be rewarded with points, amplifying Lazpad’s reach and visibility.
